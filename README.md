# Data-Plotting-with-Pandas
## Problem Description:
Understanding your data in order to get the best results from machine learning algorithms is a challenging task.The fastest way to learn more about your data is to use data visualization.

This notebook covers a mini project visualising the data by plotting data(Univariate & multivaraite) using pandas.
<br>

## Data plotting using Pandas:
* Histograms
* Density Plots
* Box and Whisker Plots
* Correlation Matrix Plot
* Scatterplot Matrix

<br>

## Libraries Required:
- Matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy

## Data Attribute Information
In this project, we'll be using diabetes using Pima Indian diabetes dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of 768 rows with 8 characteristics and an outcome, in particular:

For Each Attribute: (all numeric-valued)
   1. Number of times pregnant
   2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
   3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
   4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
   5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
   6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
   7. Diabetes pedigree function
   8. Age (years)
   9. Class variable (0 or 1)
