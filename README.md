# Data-Plotting-with-Pandas
## Problem Description:
Understanding your data in order to get the best results from machine learning algorithms is a challenging task.The fastest way to learn more about your data is to use data visualization.

This notebook covers a mini project visualising the data by plotting data(Univariate & multivaraite) using pandas.

## 1. Data plotting using Pandas:
* Histograms
* Density Plots
* Box and Whisker Plots
* Correlation Matrix Plot
* Scatterplot Matrix

## 2. Sales analysis:
use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. 
Once cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs

## 3. Pandas Basics:
   Basic Pandas Operations
